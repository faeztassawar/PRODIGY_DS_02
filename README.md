# Titanic Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes:

* 'train.csv': Training dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, their demographics, and survival status.
* 'test.csv': Test dataset for making predictions.
* 'gender_submission.csv': Sample submission file indicating the format for predictions.
